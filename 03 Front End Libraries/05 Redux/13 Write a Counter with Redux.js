/**
* Task: In this lesson, you'll implement a simple counter with Redux from
* scratch. The basics are provided in the code editor, but you'll have to fill
* in the details! Use the names that are provided and define incAction and
* decAction action creators, the counterReducer(), INCREMENT and DECREMENT
* action types, and finally the Redux store. Once you're finished you should be
* able to dispatch INCREMENT or DECREMENT actions to increment or decrement the
* state held in the store. Good luck building your first Redux app!
*/
const INCREMENT = null; // define a constant for increment action types
const DECREMENT = null; // define a constant for decrement action types

const counterReducer = null; // define the counter reducer which will increment or decrement the state based on the action it receives

const incAction = null; // define an action creator for incrementing

const decAction = null; // define an action creator for decrementing

const store = null; // define the Redux store here, passing in your reducers
