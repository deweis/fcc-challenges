# Introduction to Information Security with HelmetJS Challenges

HelmetJS is a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers to prevent sensitive information from unintentially being passed between the server and client. While HelmetJS does not account for all situations, it does include support for common ones like Content Security Policy, XSS Filtering, and HTTP Strict Transport Security, among others. HelmetJS can be installed on an Express project from npm, after which each layer of protection can be configured to best fit the project.
