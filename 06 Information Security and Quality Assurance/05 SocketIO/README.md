The first thing needing to be handled is listening for a new connection from the client. The on keyword does just that- listen for a specific event. It requires 2 arguments: a string containing the title of the event thats emitted, and a function with which the data is passed though. In the case of our connection listener, we use socket to define the data in the second argument. A socket is an individual client who is connected.

_Emit_ is the most common way of communicating you will use. When you emit something from the server to 'io', you send an event's name and data to all the connected sockets. A good example of this concept would be emitting the current count of connected users each time a new user connects!

You may notice that up to now you have only been increasing the user count. Handling a user disconnecting is just as easy as handling the initial connect except the difference is you have to listen for it on each socket versus on the whole server.

To do this, add in to your existing connect listener a listener that listens for 'disconnect' on the socket with no data passed through. You can test this functionality by just logging to the console a user has disconnected. `socket.on('disconnect', () => { /*anything you want to do on disconnect*/ });`

To make sure clients continuously have the updated count of current users, you should decrease the currentUsers by 1 when the disconnect happens then emit the 'user count' event with the updated count!

Note
Just like 'disconnect', all other events that a socket can emit to the server should be handled within the connecting listener where we have 'socket' defined.

Currently, you cannot determine who is connected to your web socket. While 'req.user' containers the user object, thats only when your user interacts with the web server and with web sockets you have no req (request) and therefor no user data. One way to solve the problem of knowing who is connected to your web socket is by parsing and decoding the cookie that contains the passport session then deserializing it to obtain the user object. Luckily, there is a package on NPM just for this that turns a once complex task into something simple!

Add `'passport.socketio'` as a dependency and require it as `'passportSocketIo'`.

Now we just have to tell Socket.IO to use it and set the options. Be sure this is added before the existing socket code and not in the existing connection listener.

Many chat rooms are able to annouce when a user connects or disconnects and then display that to all of the connected users in the chat. Seeing as though you already are emitting an event on connect and disconnect, you will just have to modify this event to support such feature. The most logical way of doing so is sending 3 pieces of data with the event: name of the user connected/disconnected, the current user count, and if that name connected or disconnected.
