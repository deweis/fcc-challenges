**Advanced Node and Express**

Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process.

The most common and easiest to use **authentication middleware** for Node.js is **Passport**. It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many strategies, which we will talk about in later challenges. In addition to authentication we will also look at template engines which allow for use of **Pug** and **web sockets** which allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server.

A **template engine** enables you to use static template files (such as those written in Pug) in your app. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values which can be supplied by your server, and transforms the template into a static HTML file that is then sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page and allows for displaying of variables on the page without needing to make an API call from the client.
