<!--
Task: Add an svg node to the body using append(). Give it a width attribute set
      to the provided w constant and a height attribute set to the provided h
      constant using the attr() method for each. You'll see it in the output
      because there's a background-color of pink applied to it in the style tag.

Note
Width and height attributes do not have units. This is the building block of
scaling - the element will always have a 5:1 width to height ratio, no matter
what the zoom level is.
