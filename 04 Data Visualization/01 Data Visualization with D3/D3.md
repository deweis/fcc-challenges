**D3.js**, or **D3**, stands for Data Driven Documents. D3 is a JavaScript library to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser. It's built to work with common web standards, namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 takes input data and maps it into a visual representation of that data. It supports many different data formats. D3 lets you bind (or attach) the data to the Document Object Model (DOM). You use HTML or SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to transform the data into a visualization.

D3 gives you a lot of control over the presentation of data.

**Methods**

D3 allows you to chain several methods together with periods to perform a number of actions in a row.

- **select**: The `select()` method selects one element from the document. It takes an argument for the name of the element you want and returns an HTML node for the first element in the document that matches the name. D3 also has the `selectAll()` method to select a group of elements. It returns an array of HTML nodes for all the items in the document that match the input string.

- **append**: The `append()` method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the document. It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and returns a handle to that node.

- **text**: The `text()` method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the current text. To set the value, you pass a string or a callback function as an argument inside the parentheses of the method.

- **style**: D3 lets you add inline CSS styles on dynamic elements with the `style()` method. It takes a comma-separated key-value pair as an argument. As well, You can use a callback function in the `style()` method to change the styling for different elements.

- **attr**: D3 has the `attr()` method to add any HTML attribute to an element, including a class name. The `attr()` method works the same way that `style()` does. It takes comma-separated values, and can use a callback function.

- **data**: See below

- **enter**: See below

**Working with Data**

The D3 library focuses on a data-driven approach. When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. The first step is to make D3 aware of the data.

The `data()` method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.

A common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the `enter()` method for this purpose.

When `enter()` is combined with the `data()` method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.

To create a **bar chart**:
  - Create a `div` for each data point in the array
  - Give each `div` a dynamic height, using a callback function in the `style()` method that sets height equal to the data value.

**SVG**: SVG stands for `Scalable Vector Graphics`. SVG is used to make common geometric shapes. Since D3 maps data into a visual representation, it uses SVG to create the shapes for the visualization. SVG shapes for a web page must go within an HTML `svg` tag. CSS can be scalable when styles use relative units (such as `vh`, `vw`, or percentages), but using SVG is more flexible to build data visualizations. There are a number of supported shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. They are used to display data.
- For example, a rectangle (`<rect>`) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart. When you place a shape into the svg area, you can specify where it goes with `x` and `y` coordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values for `x` push the shape to the right, and positive values for `y` push the shape down from the origin point.
An SVG `rect` has four attributes. There are the `x` and `y` coordinates for where it is placed in the `svg` area. It also has a `height` and `width` to specify the size.
